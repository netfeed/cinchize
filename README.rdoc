= cinchize

An early version of program which purpose is to daemonize Cinch ircbots from "simple" json config-files.

== Usage

Basic

  cinchize start -- server
  
Specify a config file, if no file is specified the cinchize is looking for it in /etc/cinchize.json

  cinchize start -- -f config.json server

Server is the name you call the a server config in the servers part of the config file, i.e. "freenode", "my_cute_bot", "quakenet" or similar. 

== Config-file

All config options can be skipped and the bot will use the defaults, but it could always be nice to connect to a server that isn't localhost, right? Plugins can be skipped too, but then the bot wouldn't do anything other then just idle.

  {
    "options" : {
      "pid" : "/path/to/pid/dir",
    },
    "servers" : {
      "freenode" : {
        "server" : "irc.freenode.net",
        "port" : 6667,
        "nick" : "Cinchbot",
        "plugins" : [
          {
            "module" : "plugin-module",
            "class" : "Cinch::Plugins::User::SomePlugin",
            "options" : { }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
